                    Over many centuries, human societies across the globe have 
                    established progressively closer contacts. Recently, the pace of 
                    global integration has dramatically increased. Unprecedented changes in communications, 
                    transportation, and computer technology have given the process new impetus and made the world more interdependent than ever. Multinational corporations manufacture products in many countries and sell to consumers around the world. Money, technology and raw materials move ever more swiftly across national borders. Along with products and finances, ideas and cultures circulate more freely. As a result, laws, economies, 
                    and social movements are forming at the international level.

                    Globalization compels businesses to adapt to different strategies based on new ideological trends that try to balance rights and interests of both the individual and the community as a whole. This change enables businesses to compete worldwide and also signifies a dramatic change for business leaders, labor and management by legitimately accepting the participation of workers and government in developing and implementing company policies and strategies. Risk reduction via diversification can be accomplished through company involvement with international
                    financial institutions and partnering with both local and multinational businesses.
